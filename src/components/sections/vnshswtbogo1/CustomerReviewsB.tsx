      text: 'I never write reviews but these flashlights are worth the extra minute to talk about...My wife and I are officially empty nesters. The last 2 left last week. I wanted something they could all have to protect themselves. 3 girls and a boy. I bought myself one to try it out. I was impressed how solid it was. Mine is the XL Baton. Light isn\'t as bright as I\'d hoped. The shock is what draws you in. I bought all the kids the "regular flashlight" it\'s about brighter but the tase is a little less. These lil guys will keep my girls and boy safe. No one will continue approaching once that hear this bug zapper on roids. It\'s loud and intimidating. I accidentally grasped the end after using the taser and it held a residual charge that cramped my hand into a fist and hurt my enter arm! The full brunt has to be painful. I recommend for your whole family, it certainly gives you piece of mind. They work better that I\'d hoped. Great EDC for even the slightest of person, a lil pricey but quality seems good, so it\'s worth it.',

I bought 2 of them. 1 for me and 1 for my wife and she loves it. I haven\'t had to use it in self defense but am certain it would do its job if necessary.',
